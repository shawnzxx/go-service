## Design Philosophy
1. don't make things easier to do, make thing easier to understand (write code in mentality for next person will maintian it)
1. Don't add complexity until we need it (you start with mono, then envolve to microservice)
1. everything we do must be precise
1. write code always start from readability then refactor to find a simplicity

## Deployment first
start from day 1, for local development you shall try to setup and test your work on local with similar enviroment setup like in staging and production, things like we want to run our applications on k8s for local deployment

## Project principal 
We shall have kind of agreement for team
project folder can not see more than 5 layers
this mgic number will keep you maintian mental model
Why becuase is easy for you understand code, review, code, talk/discuss your code
### 5 layers
1. app layer
all things we are build for binary like services and tools their main.go will exist inside app layer
1. business layer
any package that we are building like business rules, business process will put inside this layer
1. foundation layer
eventually will move to it's own repo (company kit repo) or vendor folder, which currently we temp use for this folder and could techniqually use in another project
1. vendor layer
this layer hold for other 3rd party dependencies or company internal library which your project will be used
1. zarf layer
layer of code that could hold everything need for docker, k8s, build, deployment, configuration

### layers relationship
5 layers import shall only go down can't go up, if I see business layer tying to import app layer, code review stopped
app can import everything because is the most top layer in 5, business layer can import their sub folder package or down from foundation layer

## package
we define package for provide not contain, every package we defined must provide certain APIs which accept either concrete type of data or interface type of data, we don't want to see package name like util, helps, models, types
think about it, package is we define apis that create a firewall around itself, the onlly way that expose is through it's public apis
and every apis is data transformation

package need to have same package name go file, logger folder need to have logger.go, and logger package
one good way to identify package is contain instead of previde kind package: ask youself does it make sense to have file name call package.go? if doesn;t make sense to have package.go then you could be creating contain kind of package try to avoid it

### Type system
a type system allow data input and output throught apis, we have two kind of type, concrete type or interface type 
- it allow input come into the api (concrete data or interface type)
- it allow output to come out

### API
the api can choose received data in two ways, it can use concrete type, you can also write apis accept interface type: the data not based what it is, but based on what it can do (polymorphism)
- what is polymorphism?
`A piece of code change it behivour depends on the type of concrete data it operating on`
you can write function to be polymorphism by saying I don't want concrete data by what it is, but I want concrete data based on what it can do


## Logging
structure logging convert human readable log
logger package should in foundation layer highly reusable across different project
you can not have common,util package, every package should have reason, provide somethings like net, http is good package
package provide or package common
filename try to discribe the purpose then this is smell, package should describe purpose

## configuration
### rules
- only place to read configuration is on main.go, and pass configuration down to other parts of program
- your application binary should allow to type "help" can print out all configuration options availiabe in your program, including default configuration, no singlton
- any default you have should be aloow to overwritten through env vairable or command line flags, you need to support both and command line flag shall rule them all
- default, default, default whoever clone the program down, need to run your program without any code change. except those Azure keys need to configured, but you need to write clear instruction how to do it in README.md file

## shutdown
concurrency VS parallel
concurrency means undefined out of order execution
parallel means you shall at least two threads and two cors running at same time

Goroutine general principal: parent G can not terminate when still have child G running, make sure all child G terminated before parent G terminated. 
one sample is: some people inside the handlder start a Go rountinue, then return the handler, then parent G terminated we still have child G running like orphan G

## Value VS Pointer
general rule: 
- if is pure data need to transfer in to the function, keep use value sementic
- if is API means could shared by all program to call, then pointer sememtic, like NewApp, NexContextMux() ect. those are all APIs

## polymorphism
compile time polymorphism (generic) VS runtime polymorphism (interface)
always use runtime polymorphism
when you use reflect then consider change to compile time polymorphism

## Error handlling
error like vertical signall channel, downstream layer pass error back to top layer (standard lib -> foundation -> business -> application)
we need define two types of csutom error, trustedError and shutdownError, other than these two error, all other errors return 500
we shall create middlewear layer to handle above two errors


## Metrics
### Rule of using singlton variable in package level?
1. the order of initialization of this singlton variable is not important, can init at any time any order
2. I don't need to inject any configuration during initialization, because when I need configuration we must construct in main and pass in
3. the only code should touch this variable is in the package itself, means expose some API to allow outside access this variable

## Authentication VS Authorisation
1. Overview
   - Authentication is about who you are, Authorisation is about what you can do, refer to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60538047/jwt-private-public-key-confusion
1. Authentication flow
   - Authentication flow is someone will call auth0 using private key to generate token, then append the token to call our server API, at middlewear layer we will use public key to validate JWT token signature is generated by private key 
   - Authentication generate JWT have two orgarism inside, one is HS256 (HMACSHA256) which use shared key to generate, another one is RS256 (RSASHA256) which use private key to generate, and public key to validate 
   - HS256 is faster than RS256, but HS256 is not secure, because you need to share the key to other party, if key is leaked then you are in trouble, so RS256 is more secure, but slower than HS256 
   - After Authentication passedï¼Œ normally system will use ID from token and fetch record from DB, so that we can have another layer to control user still valid or not
1. Authorisation flow 
   - After Authentication all passed, we can use claims to check what role and rights user have, then we can do Authorisation
   - We can pass authorisation flow to some 3rd party service like OPA (Open Policy Agent) to do authorisation, or we can do it in our own code

## DB migrate
we are using Darwin package to do DB migration, inside the migrate.sq, -- Version: 1.0x is important
because Darwin package will use version to track current migration version in DB and schema table will keep migrated version in hash value
if you need to change anything you need to create new version, if change on existing version which already migrated
Darwin package will report error, since hash not matched.
